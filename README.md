# Heart_Disease_Diagnostic_Analysis_Project
 A Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis project using Power BI involves creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to analyze patient data, identify key risk factors, and predict heart disease outcomes. The project aims to enhance data-driven decision-making in medical diagnostics and improve patient care...


üìç Enthusiastic to continue the next project named Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis while working as a data analyst intern at Unified Mentor. While performing this project, I successfully exported the CSV file of the cleaned heart disease dataset by using the .to_csv() function in Python to use that dataset for creating an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Power BI.

‚ùá Microsoft Power BI is known as one of the most powerful data visualization and modeling tools available in the data industry, using which I have analyzed the heart disease data provided by the organization and created an insightful dashboard that demonstrates the KPIs based on Heart Disease Status, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc., slicers based upon Chest Pain, Age group, etc., and different visuals including line chart, treemap, pie chart, etc.

üçÅ Below is a detailed overview of the project: 

‚òò Actions performed while creating the dashboard :
* Importing CSV file of the cleaned dataset exported from Python into Power BI.
* Transforming the data to perform data preprocessing like detecting data types, and removing null values or duplicates if any.
* Adding up the KPIs that represent the summary of the no. of heart disease patients, average blood pressure, average cholesterol, and max. heart rate achieved of the patients.
* Incorporating various visuals like line charts, pie charts, treemaps, etc., to determine the insights and hidden stories based on chest pain, BP, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.
* Ultimately, placing the slicers on the dashboard that filters out the entire dashboard based upon the factors of gender, chest pain, and age group.

üéà Insights drawn from the dashboard:
* The total count of individuals diagnosed with heart disease stands at 164.
* When considering all patients collectively, the mean blood pressure is calculated to be 131.6.
* The average level of cholesterol among the patients is determined to be 246.5.
* The maximum heart rate achieved among all the patients comes out to be 202.
* More than half (54.3%) of the individuals are diagnosed with the presence of heart disease.
* Males have a higher likelihood of developing heart disease compared to females.
* Individuals experiencing asymptomatic chest pain have an increased risk of developing heart disease.
* A larger proportion of men belong to the age category over 50, whereas more women belong to the age category over 55.
* People with high heart disease have higher levels of cholesterol.
* Blood pressure rises from 50 to 60 and maintains this trend until reaching 70.
* Cholesterol levels and maximum heart rate show an upward trend within the age range of 50 to 60.
* ST depression typically experiences a notable increase within the age bracket of 55 to 60 among individuals diagnosed with heart disease.

-Thank you all! ü§ù
